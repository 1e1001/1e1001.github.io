<h1>source code clock</h1>
— in which i rewrite a clock
<p>a few years ago my dad and i made this clock:</p><figure>
<img src="/res/media/clock-old.jpg" width="2400" height="1200" alt="clock-old.jpg" />
<figcaption>the clock in question, a 3d-printed orange box with an hour:minute display, also featuring one of the cats.
</figcaption></figure><p>and by “my dad and i” i mean “my dad made it and i watched”, his making also involved him programming the clock. over the years since then i’ve grown to dislike the 12-hour formatting on the clock, as i use 24-hour for all the clocks in my computers and it really stuck out against them. ideally i’d make something like:</p><figure>
<img class="img-pixel" id="clock-id" src="/res/media/clock-ida.png" width="200" height="76" alt="clock-ida.png" />
<figcaption>one day i might make this into a real clock, but for now it stays on the computer
</figcaption></figure><p>but i don’t really wanna buy four seven-segment displays for that. with the original clock however, it turned out that dad lost the source code for it (reasonable as it was already a finished thing), so in order to change anything about it i’d need to get a new source code</p><h2>attempt 1: try and reverse-engineer the existing binary</h2><p>as it turns out, with <code>avrdude</code> (the tool for flashing avr microcontrollers, like the one in the arduino) you can read the current program from the chip into a file, doing so gave me <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/1e1001/source-clock/raw/main/original.bin">this 32KiB dump</a>, however i’m lazy and can’t be bothered to learn how avr assembly works or figure out how to decompile it back to vague c++ (also doesn’t help that like all embedded projects are <code>-Os</code> since you’ve got very little flash space).</p><p>feel free to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/1e1001/source-clock/raw/main/original.bin">try and reverse-engineer it yourself</a>, however i instead chose to just write a new source for it</p><h2>attempt 2: rewrite it in rust</h2><p>but first: a quick list of the hardware:</p><ul>
<li>an entire arduino uno, might as well just be a atmega328p with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/datasheets/A000066-datasheet.pdf#page=8">a weird pinout</a></li>
<li>an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1269">adafruit 7-segment display</a> with an i²c connection</li>
<li>an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/746">adafruit gps thing</a> which connects via 9600-baud serial</li>
<li>the one thing i did make, a 3d-printed case for the thing, although entirely irrelevant for this</li>
</ul><figure>
<img src="/res/media/clock-open.jpg" width="1000" height="559" alt="clock-open.jpg" />
<figcaption>the inside of the clock, with parts labelled
</figcaption></figure><p>i thought it’d be funny to try and use embedded rust for for this, setting up a basic <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal"><code>arduino-hal</code></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://crates.io/crates/ht16k33"><code>ht16k33</code></a> project, i got it to cycle turning on the all the segments, but if i added the line to turn them off the compiled binary would be too large to flash to the board, and given that it was probably around 2 or 3 in the morning by then i decided to just give up.</p><h2>attempt 3: rewrite it in <s>rust</s> c</h2><p>might as well try raw avr c, so that i’m not reliant on needing the arduino ide to work to make things, might as well get some useful learning out of this project.</p><p>first step is to setup a dev environment:</p><div class='code-title'><b>shell.nix</b></div><div class="code"><pre aria-hidden="true">1

</figcaption></figure><h3>parsing whatever the gps is yelling out</h3><p>in the original version, the gps module was attached to pins 3 &amp; 4, and was interacted to with a software serial library, since i couldn’t be bothered to find one after spending so long finding a hardware one, i just decided to move it over to the hardware serial pins, this does however mean that the gps module needs to be unplugged whenever one reprograms the board. to test this i wrote a quick program to just echo back what the gps writes:</p><figure>
<img src="/res/media/clock-gps.png" width="975" height="826" alt="clock-gps.png" />
<figcaption>easiest way to dox yourself, posting a gps log (also some of these messages seem corrupted but whatever)
</figcaption></figure><p>the output is apparently in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183">the NMEA 0183 format</a>, after looking at some documentation, it appears that the <code>$GPRMC</code> “Recommended minimum specific GPS data” contains the date and time, and the gps sends me one of those every second, so i only need to parse those.</p><p>and by “parse” i mean:</p><ul>
<li>find a <code>$GPRMC,</code><a class="footnote" id="rev-3" href="#foot-3">³</a></li>
<li>get the next six digits for the hour/minute/seconds</li>
<li>skip until 8 <code>,</code>s get read</li>
<li>get the next <i>four</i> digits for the day/month</li>
<li>you’re done! who needs to verify checksums?</li>
</ul><h3>formatting of the date</h3><p>now that the code can read the date, and after some very sketchy timezone &amp; DST logic, i need to display it to the screen, problem is i like seconds but the display only has room for four digits, so i came up with the idea of having the clock be upside down<a class="footnote" id="rev-4" href="#foot-4">⁴</a> and using the two edge dots (which are individually addressable) indicate which quarter minute it is (<span class="mono"> ⠄⠅⠁</span>)<a class="footnote" id="rev-5" href="#foot-5">⁵</a>.</p><p>since i’m cool i also added a 12-hour mode via some <code>#define</code>s in the main.c file, with an AM/PM indicator using the extra dot character, as well as options to un-flip the display and to hide the leading zero in the hour (<code> 6:55</code> instead of <code>06:55</code>)</p><h2>all done :)</h2><figure>
