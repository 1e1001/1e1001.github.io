— in which i tell some stories
<p>I’ve made some fun names over the years, quite a few persist to this day, but many also correlate to things which don’t exist anymore, this post’ll just list a few of them.</p><h2>my username</h2><p>For the past few years I’ve gone by 1e1001 everywhere, but I haven’t always. before I had any online presence at all (child) we had an Xbox 360, on which one of the accounts I believe was titled “JackPumpkin51” (I think it was some sort of default / automatic account name?) which I’d always use when playing Minecraft or N+ or whatever Kinect nonsense we had from XBLA.</p><p>Several years later I got Minecraft on the computer, and had to create a Mojang account for that, and either that username was already used, or I just didn’t want that to be my username anymore, so my dad suggested the name <span class="cens">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="cens">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="cens">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a class="footnote" id="rev-1" href="#foot-1">¹</a> and I just went with it. For quite a few years after that I just used that as my name (except for the one month where I changed it to something else and then went back because I didn’t like it).</p><p>One day I had the idea of making a 2nd Twitter account (for some reason? I don’t remember but there was some silly reason for it) and wanted to create some short name, so I typed <code>1e100</code> into the name box (I liked the idea of being the number or something and/or “impersonating” a company), and because someone else had that username Twitter decided my handle would be <code>1e1001</code>, so I just went with that as my username because I decided that’s a better name, and over time switched my older accounts in other things to be that. my original icon for that account involved a square with numbers<a class="footnote" id="rev-2" href="#foot-2">²</a>, and somehow I’ve kept that branding up throughout my account’s life.</p><p>I’ve also gone by the name <span class="cens">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> before, a reference to <a target="_parent" href="./media/cube-icon.png"><img src="./media/cube-icon.png" class="inline-img" /></a> this icon from Geometry Dash, because I needed to think of an account name, not sure why I didn’t just go with my regular name but that’s one I sometimes use for things.</p><h2>the asyl</h2><p>Most of this history is reconstructed from old DM’s with people<a class="footnote" id="rev-3" href="#foot-3">³</a>, the dates are a bit fuzzy and there’s probably some things wrong.</p><p>In a “real friends group” Discord guild I’m in, one of the members, Bridget, was running a bot simply titled “penny bot”. I believe it was run using some online bot-making service, and one of the commands on it was <code>!die [username]</code> which would generate a Minecraft-like death message for the appropriate user (or for yourself if a user wasn’t specified). Eventually that bot got removed (I believe from Bridget not wanting to deal with maintaining it) and because I was vaguely interested in making a Discord bot at that same time, I decided to make a “successor” to it, initially titled <code>hbot</code> and having <a target="_parent" href="./media/egg-icon.png"><img src="./media/egg-icon.png" class="inline-img" /></a> this profile picture, it contained an updated version of that command and a few other silly features<a class="footnote" id="rev-4" href="#foot-4">⁴</a>.</p><p>A while later, we needed a Discord bot for a somewhat more professional guild (some vague game-dev thing), instead of just inviting the old bot, it was suggested that we get a new bot, and just reuse the same source code for it, when asked for a name I was told:</p><table class="chatlog">
<tr><th></th><th>2020-09-06 21:10</th></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="2">arsentical</th><td>on second thought</td></tr>
<tr><td>we might want to name it something more professional</td></tr>
<tr><th>1e1001</th><td>what do u mean</td></tr>
<tr><th>arsentical</th><td>the name</td></tr>
<tr><th>1e1001</th><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><th>arsentical</th><td>not hbot</td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="2">1e1001</th><td>ok</td></tr>

<tr><td>sounds cool</td></tr>
<tr><th>arsentical</th><td>stylized AntiSys or AntiSYS</td></tr>
<tr><th>…</th></tr>
<tr><th>arsentical</th><td>I prefer AntiSYS</td></tr>
</table><p>And thus AntiSYS became the name. Over the years I rewrote the bot’s source several times, peaking off at AntiSYS5 or 6<a class="footnote" id="rev-5" href="#foot-5">⁵</a>, mostly because I wanted to make a generalized plugin system in typescript and that is Hard™. during that time I got too lazy to write the full AntiSYS name, so I’d often abbreviate it to <code>asys</code>. After my departure from that group I still wanted to keep developing that bot (since it turns out that it’s somewhat fun to rewrite the same thing over and over again<a class="footnote" id="rev-6" href="#foot-6">⁶</a>). I was first just making some silly single-use bots to test out some ideas, Including things like “bot that lets you run a Linux terminal” (horribly insecure), and “bot that lets me test a lisp”. During that time the bot was simply called <code>micha.ts</code><a class="footnote" id="rev-7" href="#foot-7">⁷</a>, but after a while I decided to shorten it even more and rename it to be <code>asy</code><a class="footnote" id="rev-8" href="#foot-8">⁸</a>. And because it’s called that I decided to name the language “asy lisp”, or <code>asyl</code>. Even though the current version is not asy nor a lisp, I like the name so I’m keeping it.</p><h2>the game engine</h2><p>I’ve wanted to make my own game engine for making games for the past while, but my current game engine actually started off as a UI toolkit I was making to try to run on my Raspberry Pi’s little 480x320 touchscreen, I called it <a target="_parent" href="./media/nanoscale-icon.png"><img src="./media/nanoscale-icon.png" class="inline-img" /></a> <code>nanoscale</code> at the time because I wanted it to be a really lightweight engine. Problem was I was using OpenGL’s immediate rendering, a 2D linked list for the widgets storage, and also C++, so it was somewhat terrible to work with.</p><p>I then wanted to make something similar, and after trying out and not liking some C# game-making things, I decided to rewrite some thing in OpenGL & C, which I called <code>gle</code>, for “openGL Engine”. after pursuing that for a while I rewrote it with Vulkan & C++, so the name became <code>vke</code> for “VulKan Engine”. <a target="_parent" href="https://devpty.github.io/">We</a> then<a class="footnote" id="rev-9" href="#foot-9">⁹</a> wanted to try to finish the game engine and use it for actual games:</p><table class="chatlog">

<tr><th>…</th></tr>
<tr><th>arsentical</th><td>if not pioneer i was gonna name it after one of my old projects, because they were all named after stars and sounded cool</td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="3">1e1001</th><td>because like yeah i wanna use this in other games so we need some good name for it yeah</td></tr>
<tr><td>hmmm</td></tr>
<tr><td><s tabindex="0">i dont really like pioneer because it sounds like it does something cool and isn't a piece of shit</s></td></tr>
</table><p>After a while I decided to rewrite the engine in Rust (I’m sensing a common pattern here), and really didn’t like the name pioneer, so I asked for another name and was given <code>horizon</code>, so I went with that for a while. After going with that for a bit I also decided to rewrite it (architectural debt is my excuse), and this time I called it <code>gamework</code>, because I realized it’s more of a game framework than an engine, and that’s kind-of the current name (I need to rewrite it again, we’ll see what it’s called then)</p><h2>generalization &c</h2><p>I guess I really like doing vague wordplay for the names, especially the “no thoughts head empty” → “noughts hempty” kind of portmanteau<a class="footnote" id="rev-10" href="#foot-10">¹⁰</a>. I’ll be keeping that up for future projects most likely, it’s a really easy way to come up with fairly unique names.</p><p>In other news, the next posts (including this one) will probably just be whatever I can think of, my lang-dev motivation hasn’t been too high at the moment, especially with all the random side projects I’m partaking in. maybe I’ll rewrite my website again,</p><p><span class="mono">-michael</span></p>
